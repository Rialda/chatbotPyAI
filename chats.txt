I'm doing great, thanks for asking.
How was your day?
It was great, I'm learning new things all the time.
How's the weather today?
It's okay, but I would love it to be more sunny. 
Do you ever watch movies?
Occasionally, I have no time to watch movies all the day.
What's your favourite movie so far?
Titanic, definitely. Classic.
I also love romantic movies, can you suggest me some?
Hmm.. Valentine's Day?
Cool, I'll check it out.
Cool. You'll enjoy it.
